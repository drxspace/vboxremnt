for use by a simple (not root the default) user account

# Perhaps you'll need to install zenity with this command
sudo apt-get install -y zenity
# gksu is not recommended any more and it may be removed
# entirely from future issues of Ubuntu. 
# Nevertheless it can be installed with
sudo apt-get install -y gksu
# If you decided to install gksu and you're using the 64-bit version
# you'll need to run
gksu-properties
# once to set the authentication to sudo.
